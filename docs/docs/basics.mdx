# Basics

If you are familiar with lodash's [deep set / get functions](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#set) or the [formik](https://formik.org/) library, most of the functionality will be clear to you.

## Overview

`stocked` keeps all data in context. After that, you can watch the value changes using the `useStockValue` (if you don't want to edit the value), `useStockState` hooks or using `watch` function.

## Data

Data is saved as one object. Value set / get is done via deep set / get functions.

:::caution

Be careful! `stocked` does not support circular objects.

import { DeepPathPreview } from '../src/components/DeepPathPreview';

<DeepPathPreview
    object={{
        hello: {
            asdf: 'hello',
            co: 'asdf',
            c: {
                hello: 0,
            },
        },
        arr: [
            'asdf',
            {
                h: {
                    d: 'asdf',
                },
            },
        ],
    }}
    initialPath="hello"
