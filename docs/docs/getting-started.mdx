# Getting started

> On this page, you'll find general information about stocked.

## Motivation

If you need to share state between your components, you'll face the performance issue. Saving all your app state into context isn't good solution, because changing value causes whole app rerender.

:::tip Pro tip!

You can highlight updates when component render with [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=ru).
